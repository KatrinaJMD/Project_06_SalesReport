# Project_06_SalesReport
### <b>ABOUT</b>
Business knowledge and understanding issues are essential to a data analyst's job. They interface between specific data and a business representative.

The skills of this project are linked to the ability to write a clear and impactful analysis report. So far, we have analyzed data and provided deliverables.

The first deliverable will be a medium-sized written report (between 10 and 20 pages), introducing the sector studied and its specific issues in a preliminary section of the report.
*(Optional)* The second deliverable is a dashboard (preferably with Tableau software).

We will analyze the 2019 sales performance of a startup eCommerce tech company based in San Francisco, California. They provided a 12-month sales worth of data. Statistical and descriptive analysis is mostly easy, but if you want to predict or even recommend innovating strategies using such limited data, you will face some challenges, like in this project.

Indeed, helping a business prepare for its next step is not easy, especially if you don't have access to a lot of information, preventing you from forecasting sales and detecting the root cause of the drop or rise in sales. Many questions that usually help businesses in their decision-making are unanswered because of the lack of data. This project is about showing how data is critical for a company and how the importance of data affects them crucially.

But it should not stop Data Analysts from excelling at their job. It didn't for sure stop me from investigating further to help BaseTech improve its business. I gathered the questions based on my findings and communicated them to different departments that could help me track the root causes of the company's sales behavior. I have listed recommendations and prescriptions (*not available in this project*) and verified them one by one to ensure BaseTech detect its threats, improves its weaknesses, leverages their strength, and unlocks opportunities.
